# About

The **nisync** package allows you to develop timing and synchronization applications 
for both time-based and signal-based synchronizations with NI-Sync devices in Python.

## Documentation

Refer to the [NI-Sync User Manual](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/ni-sync/page/user-manual-welcome.html)
for API-agnostic information about NI-Sync concepts.

## Implementation

The package is implemented in Python as an 
object-oriented wrapper around the NI-Sync C API using the
[ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html) Python library.

## Supported NI-Sync Driver Versions

**nisync** supports all versions of NI-Sync. Some functions in the **nisync** 
package may be unavailable with earlier versions of NI-Sync driver. Refer to 
the [Installation](#installation) section for details on how to install the latest version 
of the NI-Sync driver.

## Operating System Support

**nisync** supports Windows and Linux operating systems where the NI-Sync
driver is supported. Refer to
[NI Hardware and Operating System Compatibility](https://www.ni.com/r/hw-support)
for which versions of the driver support your hardware on a given operating
system.

## Python Version Support

**nisync** supports CPython 3.8+ and PyPy3.

# Installation
 
Running **nisync** requires NI-Sync to be installed.
**nisync** can be installed with [pip](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>):

```shell
python -m pip install nisync
```

## Manual Driver Installation

Visit [ni.com/downloads](http://www.ni.com/downloads/) to download the latest
version of NI-Sync. None of the recommended **Additional items** are required
for **nisync** to function, and they can be removed to minimize installation
size. It is recommended you continue to install the **NI Certificates** package
to allow your Operating System to trust NI built binaries, improving your
software and hardware installation experience.

# Getting Started

In order to use the **nisync** package, you must have at least one device that supports NI-Sync 
installed on your system. Both physical and simulated devices are supported.
You can use **NI MAX** or **NI Hardware Configuration Utility** to verify and configure your devices.

Finding and configuring device name in **NI MAX**:
![NI Max Device Name](https://github.com/wchung-ni/wk_nisync-python/blob/466ab4a0ac743826abd497b552004284f00a874a/docs/img/max_device_name.png)

Finding and configuring device name in **NI Hardware Configuration Utility**:
![NI HWCU Device Name](https://github.com/wchung-ni/wk_nisync-python/blob/466ab4a0ac743826abd497b552004284f00a874a/docs/img/hwcu_device_name.png)


# Usage
The following is a basic example of using an **nisync.nisync.Session** object. This example illustrates how to connect and disconnect clock terminals to synchronize devices using the onboard oscillator as the clock source. This is particularly useful in applications requiring precise timing and synchronization across multiple devices.

## Python Examples

```python
import nisync
from nisync.constants import PXI_CLK10_IN, OSCILLATOR

# Create a new session with the nisync library
with nisync.Session(resource_name="PXI1Slot10") as session:
    # Connect the onboard oscillator to the PXI_CLK10_IN terminal
    # This setup is typically used for synchronizing measurements across devices
    session.connect_clock_terminals(OSCILLATOR, PXI_CLK10_IN)
    
    # Perform measurements or operations that require synchronization
    
    # Once operations are complete, disconnect the terminals
    session.disconnect_clock_terminals(OSCILLATOR, PXI_CLK10_IN)
```
